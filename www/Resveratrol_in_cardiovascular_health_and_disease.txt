Resveratrol, initiallyused for cancer therapy, has shownbeneficial effects againstmostdegenerative andcardiovascular
diseases from atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion, and heart failure to diabetes, obesity, and aging.
The cardioprotective effects of resveratrol are associated with its preconditioning-like action potentiated by its
adaptive response.During preconditioning, small doses of resveratrol can exert an adaptive stress response, forcing the
expression of cardioprotective genes and proteins such as heat shock and antioxidant proteins. Similarly, resveratrol
can induce autophagy, another formof stress adaptation for degrading damaged or long-lived proteins, as a first line
of protection against oxidative stress. Resveratrol¡¦s interactionwithmultiple molecular targets of diverse intracellular
pathways (e.g., action on sirtuins and FoxOs through multiple transcription factors and protein targets) intertwines
with those of the autophagic pathway to give support in the modified redox environment after stem cell therapy,
which leads to prolonged survival of cells. The successful application of resveratrol in therapy is based upon its
hormetic action similar to any toxin: exerting beneficial effects at lower doses and cytotoxic effects at higher doses.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major
causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed
nations, including the United States.1 About 100
million Americans suffer from some kind of CVD
including highblood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary
heart disease, or stroke. Thirty-nine percent of
all deaths¡Xor one in every three deaths¡Xis claimed
to be caused by a heart disease. Although proper
medicines are abundant in developing countries to
combat CVDs, preventive measures appear to be
necessary to lower the incidence of heart problems.
Maintaining a healthy heart is particularly important
for thosewith a family history of coronary heart
disease including hypertension, heart attack, and
atherosclerosis. Fortunately, a number of natural
cures are available that appear to maintain cardiovascular
health. For example,maintaining a healthy
lifestyle, daily exercise, and choosing proper diets
certainly help maintain a healthy heart.2,3 Certain
mineral-rich foods including those high in potassium,
calcium, and magnesium can control blood
pressure. Low-fat milks are rich sources of calcium,
while magnesium and potassium can be found in
green vegetables and fish oil. Among the fatty foods,
limiting saturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated,
and trans- fats would help reduce cholesterol
and associated forms of coronary heart diseases.
Major sources of saturated fat include beef, butter,
cheese, whole milk, and coconut and palm oils.
In contrast, polyunsaturated fats like omega-3-fatty
acids containing foods including fish oil, flax seed
oil, and canola oil may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Someof the examples formaintaining a healthy
heart include garlic, olive oil, broccoli, capsicum,
coenzyme Q10, Terminalia arjuna, Ashwagandha
(Withania somnifera), cocoa, and fish oil, most of
which are included in the Mediterranean diet. Numerous
reports are available in the literature about
heart healthy diet from Mediterranean foods.4,5
First published in 1992 as the French Paradox, the
health benefits of daily drinking of wine in moderation
has been proven by most of the scientists and

clinicians all over the world.6 Wine contains 11¡V
14% alcohol and many polyphenolic compounds,
most of which possess antioxidant properties. Although
alcohol possesses cardioprotective properties,
it is universally believed that it is not the alcohol
but some of the polyphenols present in wine
that are responsible for the cardioprotective properties
of wine.7 Among the polyphenols present in
wine, especially red wine, resveratrol has drawn major
attention. Resveratrol is present in the skins of
grapes and thus in red wine. In addition to grapes,
resveratrol is present in a large variety of fruits including
cranberry, mulberry, lingonberry, bilberry,
partridgeberry, sparkleberry, deerberry, blueberry,
jackfruit, peanut, as well as in a wide variety of
flowers and leaves including gnetum, butterfly orchid
tree, white hellebore, scots pine, corn lily, eucalyptus,
and spruce. Commercially, resveratrol is
extracted from the dried roots of Polygonum cuspidatum,
mainly found in Japan and China. Polygonum
extract has been used in Japanese and Chinese
traditional medicine to treat fungal infections,
various skin inflammations, liver disease, and cardiovascular
problems.8 Resveratrol is also an antifungal
compound that is synthesized in response
to environmental stressors including water deprivation,
UV radiation, and especially fungal infection.9
A growing body of evidence now supports the
notion that resveratrol is the major factor responsible
for the cardioprotective effects of wine. In
the heart, resveratrol blocks low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) peroxidation, increases high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) levels, induces vasorelaxation
presumably through the induction of nitric oxide
(NO) synthesis, inhibits endothelin (ET), modifies
angiogenic response, reduces ventricular arrhythmias,
possesses antithrombin activity and prevents
platelet aggregation, inhibits formation of soluble
adhesion molecules, reduces reactive oxygen species
(ROS), reduces blood pressure, and ameliorates ischemic
reperfusion injury (Fig. 1).8,10¡V12 It is believed
that resveratrol-mediated cardioprotection is
not due to its direct drug-like effect on the diseased
heart, rather, it potentiates a preconditioning
(PC)-like effect, a state-of-the art for cardioprotection.
The PC effect results from an adaptive
response, which receives further support from a recent
discovery that resveratrol promotes autophagy
(Fig. 2).13,14 More recently, resveratrol has been
found to regenerate the infracted myocardium.11
Figure 1. Effects of resveratrol on cardiovascular health and
other diseases. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL), low-density lipoprotein
(LDL), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Resveratrol appears to maintain a healthy heart in
numerous ways, and can provide numerous health
benefits, which will be the subject of discussion in
this review.
Resveratrol and cardiovascular health
As mentioned earlier, CVDs¡Xbeing the leading
cause of death and illness worldwide¡Xare greatly
dependent not only on nonmodifiable predisposing
factors (age, sex, and genetic composition),
but also on a modifiable factor¡Xthe lifestyle. Indeed,
risk factors other than increased plasma
cholesterol15 and obesity,16 such as oxidative stress,
inflammation, and endothelial damage, all have
great relevance in the development of CVD. One
of the most well-known benefits of resveratrol is
improvement of cardiovascular health (Fig. 1).17
Resveratrol, in physiologic concentrations after red
wine consumption, increases the expression of
NO synthase, an enzyme responsible for synthesizing
the potent vasodilator NO in human vascular
endothelial cells.18 Resveratrol also decreases
the expression of the potent vasoconstrictor ET.18
Cerebral ischemic damage in rat brains can be prevented
via pretreatment with resveratrol19 by activating
sirtuin (Sirt) 1, coupled with a decrease
in mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 and an
increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesizing efficiency.
19 Resveratrol can also exert cardioprotection

by inhibiting platelet aggregation, similar to how aspirin
works.17 In the following sections, the beneficial
effects of resveratrol, as summarized inFigure 1,
will be briefly discussed in relation to some major
heart problems.
Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the
arterial wall caused by endothelial wall damage
during continuous hemodynamic and redox stress
conditions.20 Under such conditions, modified
LDLs, lipids, and fibrous elements can accumulate
in the wall. Its progression into plaque disruption
can lead to local thrombosis and acute coronary
syndrome.21,22 As previously mentioned, resveratrol
can regulate the production of NO, a potent
vasodilator, by counterbalancing the effect of the
vasoconstrictor ET-1,18,23¡V25 thus providing
thromboresistance and preventing atherogenesis.24
Resveratrol can potentially inhibit stress-induced
ET-1 gene expression by interferingwith its promoting
extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK)
1/2 pathway26 and therefore improve endothelial
function.27
Inflammation mediates all stages of atherosclerosis
from initiation to progression and, eventually,
plaque rupture. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a
key role in inflammation¡Xits synthesis is catalyzed
by cyclooxygenase (COX) 2. Resveratrol can inhibit
the atherosclerosis-associated inflammation via regulating
the COX-2 activity at a transcriptional level,
thereby inhibiting the production of PGE2.28 In culturedmurine
macrophages, resveratrol can suppress
the proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression,
protein synthesis, and secretion,29,30 and
inhibit the release of both IL-8 and granulocytemacrophage
colony-stimulating factor.31 Oxidation
of LDL and uptake into the vascular wall as a
main cause of endothelial injury and inflammation
can be prevented by resveratrol.32 Endothelial
cell injury, platelet aggregation, and adherence to
the injured cell surface can be blocked by this stilbene,
inhibiting further the adhesion of collagen to
platelets33 and ADP-induced platelet aggregation34
in a concentration-dependent manner.35 Low concentrations
of resveratrol can significantly inhibit
intracellular and extracellular ROS production36 by
enhancing the intracellular free radical scavenger
glutathione.37
Oxidized lipids, metabolic stress, and inflammation
in atherosclerotic plaques can also induce
autophagy as a safeguard against cellular distress
by degrading damaged intracellular material. Basal
autophagy can be enhanced by certain drugs for
cardioprotection, which can reach damaging and
autophagic cell death levels under excessive stimulation.
38 Loss of smooth muscle cells may lead to
plaque destabilization and rupture under excessive
cell death and autophagy conditions.39 However,
therapeutic induction of autophagy in atherosclerotic
plaque resolution may have a counterbalancing
effect on other survival or cell death pathways
such as apoptosis and necrosis.
Hypertension
Higher systemic blood pressure (SBP) associates
with increased heart weight, serum ET-1, angiotensin
II (AngII) concentrations, and decreased
serum NO. Resveratrol decreases SBP, heart weight,
ET-1, and AngII concentrations while increases
the vasodilator NO concentration, which protects
against increased SBP and subsequent cardiac hypertrophy
in mice.40,41 Mean arterial pressure after
resveratrol treatment dropped significantly in
spontaneously hypertensive rats.42 In another study
on rats treated with resveratrol, echocardiographic

Petrovski et al. Resveratrol in heart health
analysis of cardiac structure and function after
hypertensive stress showed improvement in the interventricular
septal wall thickness and left ventricular
posterior wall thickness, as well as isovolumetric
relaxation time at systole and diastole.
Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), and redox factor-1 (ref-1)
were significantly decreased under these stress conditions.
Resveratrol may therefore be beneficial
against certain types of cardiac hypertrophy found
in clinical settings of hypertension and aortic valve
stenosis.
For the last 30 years it has been know that lysosomal
pathways are involved in the different models
of heart disease.43¡V47 More recently, advances in
our understanding of autophagy have revealed that
hemodynamic load-induced aggregation of intracellular
proteins may have a protective role.48 However,
excessive pressure overload may elicit a robust
autophagic response in cardiomycytes that is maladaptive
and contributes to disease progression.
Ischemia/reperfusion injury and PC
PC is a protective and adaptive phenomenon
whereby brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R) render the heart resistant to subsequent
ischemic injury or stress. A large number of stimuli
such as short cyclic episodes of I/R, a number
of pharmacological agents (agonists of adenosine,
bradykinin, adrenergic and muscarinic receptor,
NOdonors, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors), and
various noxious stimuli (endotoxins, cytokines, and
ROS) have been found to generate PC-like phenotype.
49 Resveratrol can similarly precondition the
heart in a NO-dependent manner (Fig. 3), inducing
the expression of iNOS, eNOS, and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in rats.50
Resveratrol provided cardioprotection as evidenced
by superior postischemic ventricular recovery, reduced
myocardial infarct size, and decreased number
of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Resveratrol likely
activates both adenosine A1 and A3 receptors
that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
(PI3K), which then phosphorylates protein kinase
B (Akt) and thus preconditions the heart by producing
NO, as well as by the activation of antioxidant
Bcl-2.50,51 Activation of adenosineA3 receptors
could also precondition the heart by a survival signal
through the cAMP response element-binding
protein (CREB) phosphorylation via PI3K/Akt and
via MERK (mitogen-activated extracellular signalregulated
protein kinase)/CREB pathways.52 Recent
studies have also demonstrated that NO can induce
the expression of heme oxygenase-1. Tin protoporphyrin
(SnPP), a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
inhibitor, abolished increased cardiac function parameters,
reduced myocardial infarct size, and decreased
cardiomyocyte apoptosis that characterize
the cardioprotection with resveratrol.53 The HO-
1¡Vmediated mechanisms were related to the p38
MAP kinase and Akt survival signaling but independent
of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) activation.
A polyphenol, resveratrol, protects the heart
by its antioxidative properties through various redox
signaling mechanisms. The ability of resveratrol
to modulate redox signaling has been extensively reviewed,
54,55 but the role of Sirt activation in the heart
is yet to be determined.Whitewine lacking polyphenols
but containing antioxidant compounds such
as caffeic acid and tyrosol mediated cardioprotection
against I/R injury in rat hearts work via similar
survival pathway involving Akt/FOXO3a/NF-
B.56 Our recent results also indicate that at lower
doses, resveratrol-mediated survival of cardiac myoblasts
is, in part, mediated through the induction
of autophagy,57 which, along other enhanced
survival signals, helps to recover the cells from
injury.58
Angiogenesis
Resveratrol in general has angiosuppressive
effects¡Xrat gliomas significantly decrease in size
upon resveratrol treatment.59 Proliferation and migration
of vascular endothelial cells under resveratrol
treatment activates eukaryotic elongation
factor-2 kinase, which in turn inactivates elongation
factor-2, an important factor in protein translation.
60 In mice that develop abnormal angiogenesis
in the retina after laser treatment, when given
resveratrol, the abnormal blood vessels began to disappear.
Similarly, resveratrol suppressed the growth
of new blood vessels in animals by directly inhibiting
capillary endothelial cell growth61¡Xit blocked
the VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
receptor-mediated angiogenic responses and significantly
delayed angiogenesis-dependent wound
healing. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs) to low doses of resveratrol
significantly blocks VEGF-mediated migration
and tube formation but not cell proliferation.26

Figure 3. (A) Typical electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra recorded from the reduction of nitroxide during ischemia of the
isolated heart. The reduction in nitroxide resulted in a decrease in the ESR signal intensity over time during the ischemic phase.
(B) The decrease in signal intensity over time was fit to determine the rate of decay of the ischemic heart in control and resveratroltreated
hearts. (C) The rate of decay of the TEMPO nitroxide (2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl) during ischemic challenge

Under the same concentrations, resveratrol fails to
affect VEGF-stimulated activation of VEGF receptor,
extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2,
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt. Interestingly,
at low micromolar doses, resveratrol effectively
abrogates VEGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation
of vascular endothelial cadherin and its
complex partner, -catenin.
Insufficient angiogenesis can result in nutritional
andmetabolic deficiency, igniting prosurvival pathways
of autophagy in cells and tissues. In this case
as well, the double-edged sword of autophagy is evident,
since low-level induction of this pathway may
be prosurviving for the deficiently supplied tissue,
but excessive autophagy in cells can be destructive
and possibly proinflammatory.62,63
Metabolic syndrome: diabetes and obesity
Although most of the research done on the positive
effect of resveratrol and its antidiabetic potential has
been conducted on animals, the results from our
own laboratory show that injecting streptozotosin
diabetic rats with this compound results in a significant
decrease in the levels of blood glucose.64 Similarly,
direct injection of resveratrol into the brains of
diabetic rats resulted in reduction of insulin levels
like it does in hyperinsulinemic rats. A recent study
reported that long-term intracerebroventricular infusion
of resveratrol-normalized hyperglycemia and
greatly improved hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced
obese and diabetic mice65 independent of changes
in body weight, food intake, and circulating leptin
levels. In addition, central nervous system resveratrol
delivery improves hypothalamicNF-B inflammatory
signaling by reducing acetylated-RelA/p65
and total RelA/p65 protein contents and inhibitor
of NF-B alpha and beta mRNA levels. Furthermore,
this treatment leads to reduced hepatic
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 mRNA and
protein levels and ameliorates pyruvate-induced hyperglycemia
in this mouse model of type 2 diabetes.
The mechanism of resveratrol¡¦s action is by

Petrovski et al. Resveratrol in heart health
far complex and still evolving.Obesity studies in our
laboratory demonstrate that resveratrol renders the
hearts of ob/ob mice resistant to ischemic reperfusion
injury.66 The antidiabetic potential of resveratrol
appears to warrant further promise of imposing
the same effect on humans.
Insulin signaling,which enhances protein synthesis,
also inhibits autophagy in insulin target tissues.67
Thus, there is the potential for alterations in this
control in insulin-resistant states such as diabetes,
and defects in autophagy may adversely affect cell
function in diabetes. Such defects may lead to inappropriate
accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria,
insulin granules, or activation of apoptotic
pathways. Furthermore, various cellular stresses can
induce dysfunctional protein folding, which can
cause the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated
proteins in cells.68,69 Inability of the autophagy pathway
to clear protein aggregates may be intimately
related to cell death in diabetes.
Longevity
The first revolutionary discovery that resveratrol can
activate the antiaging gene SIRT170 has been followed
by recent studies supporting this antiaging
function. However, animal studies of the dose effect
of resveratrol would mean that one needs to consumeseveral
bottles of redwine perday to reachsuch
a dose.71 More recently, low dose of resveratrol has
been found to activate not only SIRT1, but also SIRT
3 and SIRT 4 as well as FoxOs and pre-B cell colonyenhancing
factor (PBEF)¡Xall being proteins linked
or associated with longevity.72 In addition, white
wine and its components tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol
have been found to activate same longevity
genes, suggesting that activation of SIRT1 could be
a nonspecific phenomenon. Resveratrol prevented
age-related and obesity-related cardiovascular functional
decline in mice, but did not affect the overall
survival or maximum life span for mice on a standard
diet, compared to mice on the same diet with
resveratrol.73 Different species appear to increase
their life span upon resveratrol, from yeast and nematodes
toflies (Drosophila melanogaster), aswell as
mice kept on a high fat diet. In another related study,
SIRT1 overexpression enhanced the autophagic flux
in cancer cells, and this effect was blocked by inhibitors
of its catalytic activity. Resveratrol induced
autophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans also via activation
of SIRT2; this effect was abolished by siRNA
mediated depletion of SIRT2.74 Autophagy, in turn,
increases life expectancy of the worm.
A substantial amount of evidence suggests that
resveratrol mimics calorie restriction and increases
the life span. Ongoing research to identify an ideal
antiaging compound has not been successful. To
date, calorie restriction remains the only effective
mean to increase the life span,75 although the
mechanisms whereby calorie restriction increases
life span remain speculative. Several reports can be
found in the literature supporting the role of exercise
and certain chemicals such as rapamycin and resveratrol
in expanding life span.76 A study using microarray
revealed that out of 6,347 modified genes by
calorie restriction, about 58 genes displayed at least
twofold alterations in gene expression.77 There is a
striking similarity between resveratrol and calorie
restriction on the alteration of metabolic pathways.
For example, both resveratrol and calorie restriction
improve insulin sensitivity thereby reducing the insulin
and glucose levels in the body,78 which in turn
reduce the life-threatening cardiovascular risk factors.
Both resveratrol and calorie restriction can potentiate
the expression of Glucose transporter type 4
(GLUT4).66 As mentioned earlier, the most important
antiaging gene that is upregulated by calorie restriction
and resveratrol is SIRT1, although it works
in coordination with the FoxOs. Indeed, resveratrol
and red wine containing significant amount of
resveratrol that can inactivate the FoxOs by phosphorylation.
72
In a recent study, life extension of fish by resveratrol
was associated with the change in the slope
of mortality trajectory,79 indicating lowering of the
time-dependent increase in death risk with resveratrol.
In the same study, the authors noticed an initial
increase in death rate after resveratrol treatment,
suggesting that the weak toxic effect of resveratrol
was associated with a stress response that ultimately
increased the expression of longevity genes, thereby
increasing the life span. A similar effect was observed
in Drosophila, when hypothermia was associated
with a reduction in the accumulation of agedependent
irreversible injury.80 This effect was quite
different from the life extension induced by calorie
restriction, which is reflected in time-dependent reduction
in acute risk of death without changing the
slope of mortality rate.80

Resveratrol in heart health Petrovski et al.
Resveratrol and autophagy
On the basis of our previous observation that cardioprotection
induced by ischemic PC induces autophagy
and that resveratrol induces PC-like effects,
we sought to determine if resveratrol could induce
autophagy. Macroautophagy, commonly known as
autophagy, involves a bulk degradation process
clearing organelles, long-lived proteins, and protein
complexes. Cytosolic constituents destined to
be degraded become enclosed by double membrane
structures, known as autophagosomes or autophagic
vacuoles, which are fused with lysosomes
followed by the degradation of its contents. In fact,
the name explains the term autophagy, a housekeeping
process through self-cannibalism or eating
inside-out.
Three types of autophagy are known: (i) microautophagy
involving ¡§dumping¡¨ of cytosolic
constituents into the lysosome by direct invagination
of the lysosomal membrane followed by
budding of vesicles into the lysosomal lumen; (ii)
macroautophagy, or autophagy involving the formation
of a double membrane structure known as
an autophagosome, which sequesters cytosolic constituents
to be delivered into the lysosomes for digestion;
and (iii) chaperone-mediated autophagy characterized
by selectivity of cytosolic proteins to be
degraded. Any autophagic process undergoes four
stages: (i) induction by external stress, such as environmental
stress (e.g., oxidative stress), nutritional
stress (e.g., nutritional deprivation), and physical
stress (e.g., ischemia or hypoxia)¡Xthe gatekeeper
for induction is mTOR, which regulates transcriptional
activation of downstreamtarget genes; (ii) autophagosome
formation, as described earlier, where
a number of autophagy (Atg) genes participate and
recruit beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein
light-chain 3 (LC3); (iii) autophagosomes undergo
docking and fusion with the lysosome; and finally
(iv) autophagic vesicles are broken down by lysosomal
proteases, where lysosomal-associated membrane
protein 2 (LAMP-2) plays a crucial role in the
degradation process.
In a recent publication, we demonstrated that
resveratrol at lower doses (0.1 and 1 M in H9c2
cardiac myoblast cells and 2.5 mg/kg/day in rats)
induced cardiac autophagy shown by enhanced
formation of autophagosomes and its component
LC3-II after hypoxia-reoxygenation or ischaemiareperfusion.
11 Autophagy was attenuated with the
higher dose of resveratrol, suggesting hormetic
action of resveratrol, and the induction of autophagy
was correlated with enhanced cell survival
and decreased apoptosis. Treatmentwith rapamycin
(100 nM), a known inducer of autophagy, did not
further increase autophagy compared with resveratrol
alone.11 Autophagic inhibitors, wortmannin
(2M), and 3-methyladenine (10mM)significantly
attenuated resveratrol-induced autophagy and induced
cell death.11 The activation of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) was differentially regulated
by low-dose resveratrol, i.e., the phosphorylation
of mTOR at serine 2448 was inhibited, whereas
the phosphorylation of mTOR at serine 2481 was
increased, which was attenuated with a higher dose
of resveratrol.11 Although resveratrol attenuated the
activation of mTOR complex 1, low-dose resveratrol
significantly induced the expression of rictor, a
component of mTOR complex 2, and activated its
downstream survival kinase Akt (Ser 473).11
Resveratrol-induced rictor was found to bind
with mTOR. Furthermore, treatment with rictor
siRNA attenuated the resveratrol-induced autophagy.
These results indicate that at lower doses,
resveratrol-mediated cell survival is, in part, mediated
through the induction of autophagy involving
the mTOR-rictor survival pathway.11
It appears that resveratrol can generate a survival
signal through autophagy. The important question
is, ¡§can we use such autophagy clinically for the
health benefits?¡¨ The simple answer is yes, if the
amount of stress can be controlled. There is no
doubt that a small amount of stress induced by
resveratrol can induce autophagy generating a survival
signal, while the same autophagy (induced
by higher doses of resveratrol) will potentiate a
death signal if the amount of such stress is large
and becomes cytotoxic to the cells. Thus, a ¡§therapeutic
amount of stress¡¨ (5¡V10 mM resveratrol)
must be defined for the induction of autophagy, the
same amount that has been known to induce an
¡§adaptive response¡¨ for the cells subjected to hostile
environment.
Resveratrol in regeneration of infracted
myocardium
Another recent study from our laboratory using
cardiac stem cells demonstrated that resveratrol
can potentiate the regeneration of infracted myocardium.
57 A major problem in the effectiveness
28 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1215 (2011) 22¡V33 c 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.
Petrovski et al. Resveratrol in heart health
of stem cell therapy is the death of stem cells due
to the oxidative environment present in the normal
tissue. Reduction of oxidative stress or maintaining
a reduced environment in the target tissue
can enhance stem cell survival and cardiac regeneration
after stem cell therapy. In the study mentioned,
57 we pretreated ratswith resveratrol (2.5mg/
kg/day gavaged for 2 weeks) after which a left anterior
descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion
was carried, followed by direct injection of
adult cardiac stem cells stably expressing enhanced
green-fluorescent protein (EGFP) on the border
zone of the myocardium through survival surgery.
The prevalence of cardiac-reduced environment was
seen in resveratrol-treated rat hearts via significantly
enhanced redox signaling observed through the nuclear
factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), stromal cellderived
factor-1 (SDF1), andNF-B, aswell as ref-1,
seven days after LAD occlusion.57 Significantly improved
cardiac functional parameters (left ventricular
ejection fraction and fractional shortening),
enhanced stem cell survival and proliferation (expression
of cell proliferation marker Ki67), and differentiation
of stem cells toward the regeneration
of the myocardium (expression of EGFP) was evident
28 days after LADocclusion in rats treatedwith
resveratrol, compared to control rats.57 Our study
clearly demonstrated that resveratrol canmodify the
physiological redox environment within the myocardium.
Maintaining a reduced tissue environment
by treatment with resveratrol in rats enhanced
the cardiac regeneration by adult cardiac stem cells
via improved cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation,
leading to improved cardiac function.
This study is the first demonstrating that nutritional
modification of the redox environment with resveratrol
can prolong the regeneration of the infracted
myocardium.57
In addition cardiac stemcells were modified with
resveratrol by preincubating the cells stably expressing
EGFP with 10 mM resveratrol for 60 min followed
by washing the cells with buffer to get rid of
any free resveratrol.57 Rats were anesthetized, their
hearts were opened, and LAD was occluded to induce
a heart attack. The animals were divided into
two groups: one group was treated with resveratrolmodified
stem cells, while the other group was
treated with stem cells alone. One week after the
LAD occlusion, the cardiac-reduced environment
was confirmed in resveratrol-treated rat hearts by
the enhanced expression ofNrf2 andRef-1.M-mode
echocardiography was performed to determine cardiac
function up to three months after the stem
cell therapy. Initially (after 72 h), both groups revealed
improvement in cardiac function, but only
the resveratrol-modified stem cell group revealed
improvement in cardiac function (left ventricular
ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and cardiac
output) at the end of the 1, 2, and 4 months period.
The improvement in cardiac functionwas accompanied
by the enhanced stem cell survival and proliferation
as evidenced by the expression of cell proliferation
marker Ki67 and differentiation of stem cells
toward the regeneration of the myocardium as evidenced
by the expression of EGFP up to six months
after LAD occlusion in the resveratrol-treated stem
cell group of hearts.57 Again, our results demonstrate
that resveratrol maintained a reduced tissue
environment by overexpressing Nrf2 and Ref-1 in
rat hearts up to four months, resulting in an enhancement
of the regeneration of the adult cardiac
stem cells as evidenced by increased cell survival
anddifferentiation leading to improved cardiac
function.
Resveratrol and hormones
Several recent studies implicate that resveratrol displays
hormetic action, protecting the cells at lower
doses while killing them at relatively higher doses.
Since such a hormetic behavior might have significant
impact on epidemiological and clinical studies,
we sought to determine the dose¡Vresponse curve for
resveratrol action.We fed by gavaging up to 30 days a
group of rats three different doses of resveratrol 2.5,
and 100 mg/kg while the control group was given
vehicles only. Our results indeed showed hormesis
for resveratrol, being cardioprotective at lower doses
only and detrimental for higher doses (D. Das, J.
Clin. Exp. Cardiol., in press). At 100 mg/kg dose,
100% of the hearts died in case of resveratrol.a The
results clearly demonstrate that resveratrol is beneficial
to the heart only at low doses and is detrimental
at higher doses. Also, the action of resveratrol is
quickly realized, in most cases within 14 days; up
to 30 days, resveratrol does not add any additional
benefit. Such hormesis has been known for more

than 100 years and frequently observed among the
toxins. As mentioned earlier, resveratrol is a phytoalexin,
whose growth is stimulated by environmental
stress such as fungal infection, ultraviolet
(UV) radiation, and water deprivation.81 Cardioprotective
effects of resveratrol are exerted through
its ability to precondition a heart through adaptive
response, which causes the development of intracellular
stress leading to the upregulation of intracellular
defense system such as antioxidants and heat
shock protein.82 Preconditioning is another example
of hormesis, which is potentiated by subjecting
an organ like heart to cyclic episodes of short durations
of ischemia, each followed by another short
durations of reperfusion.83 Such small but therapeutic
amount of stress renders the heart resistant
to subsequent lethal ischemic injury. Such an adaptive
response is commonly observed with aging. Autophagy
also constitutes another form of adaptive
response. Consistent with this idea, resveratrol has
been found to stimulate longevity genes, and at least
in prokaryotic species extend the life span. In this
respect, resveratrol may fulfill the definition of a
hormetin.84 There is no doubt that alcohol, wine,
and wine-derived resveratrol all display hormesis. It
has been known for quite some time that cardioprotective
effects of alcohol or wine intake follow a
J-shaped curve.85 This study (D. Das, J. Clin. Exp.
Cardiol. in press) echoed this concept that cardioprotective
effects of resveratrol follow a J-shaped
curve and display hormesis (Fig. 4). At lower doses,
resveratrol acts as an antiapoptotic agent, providing
cardioprotection as evidenced by increased
expression in cell survival proteins, improvedpostischemic
ventricular recovery, and reduction of myocardial
infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis
by maintaining a stable redox environment compared
to control. At higher doses, however, resveratrol
depresses cardiac function, elevates levels of
apoptotic protein expressions, results in an unstable
redox environment, and increases myocardial
infarct size and number of apoptotic cells. A significant
number of reports are available in the literature
to show that at a high dose, resveratrol not only hinders
tumor growth, but also inhibits the synthesis of
RNA, DNA, and protein; causes structural chromosome
abberrations, chromatin breaks, chromatin
exchanges, weak aneuploidy, and higher S-phase arrest;
blocks cell proliferation; and decreases wound
healing, endothelial cell growth by VEGF and FGF-
2, and angiogenesis in healthy tissue cells leading to
cell death.86¡V89
Summary and conclusion
Resveratrol, a grape- and wine-derived phytoalexin
polyphenol, provides diverse health benefits, the
most prominent being the best natural medicine
to cure diverse CVDs including atherosclerosis,
hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion, heart failure,
diabetes, obesity, and aging. Resveratrol-mediated
cardioprotection is not due to its drug-like action
neutralizing the toxins introduced by the disease;
rather, the protection is realized from its PC-like
effects potentiated by its adaptive response. During
the PC, a small amount of resveratrol (defined
as therapeutic dose) exerts adaptive stress response
thereby enabling the cardiac cells to make cardioprotective
genes and proteins such as heat shock
and antioxidant proteins. The ability of resveratrol
toexert adaptive response is further supportedby its
ability to induce autophagy, another form of adaptation
to stress. In that context, autophagy may be
viewed as ¡§cry for survival,¡¨ and such survival is a
result of adaptive response to fight against stress.
If the stress¡Xsuch as oxidative stress¡Xis mild, it
generates an adaptive response to survive against it.
Autophagy results in a survival signal by inducing a

Petrovski et al. Resveratrol in heart health
number of genes and transcription factors that alter
the stress-induced death signal into a survival signal,
leading to production of antiapoptotic or antideath
proteins. On the other hand, if the stress is overwhelming,
the adaptive response fails and the cells
die due to induction of apoptotic signals. It is important
to remember that to survive, cellsmust get rid of
damaged, detrimental, and unwanted components,
and they do so through autophagy. Thus, resveratrol
may be used clinically to induce autophagy leading
to cardioprotection. Finally, resveratrol can modify
the redox environment within the cells through its
ability to induce redox protein thioredoxin, which
can pave the way for stem cell survival. Recent studies
documented its ability to regenerate the infracted
myocardium up to four months after the cell therapy.
An important thing to remember is that for
successful application of resveratrol in therapy, one
must recognize the fact that resveratrol possesses
hormetic action similar to any toxins, exerts beneficial
action at lower doses, and becomes cytotoxic
at higher doses, generating a J-shaped or inverted
U-shape curve like wine and alcohol.
Further research and more clinical studies are
necessary in order to ensure the safety of resveratrol
and also for ascertaining the optimum doses and
ways of inducing low-level autophagy for prevention
and treatment.The findings that resveratrol can
potentiate diverse health benefits from chemoprevention
to cardioprotection¡Xthrough its ability to
induce autophagy and cardiac regeneration through
prolonging the stem cell survival¡Xcertainly warrants
an opening of a new era of pharmaceutical
intervention in cardiovascular medicine.
